# Google-Photos-Metadata-Restorer
A Python script to restore metadata (EXIF, GPS, Date Taken) to Google Photos backups downloaded via Google Takeout. This script works on JPG, PNG, HEIC, MOV, and MP4 files, ensuring the correct metadata is added back to the images and videos before they are re-uploaded to Google Photos.
